## The project

Vertical transmission â€“ isofemale lines and rearing in closed conditions free from external microbes to examine transfer of bacteria between generations 

## About

This script uses the rarefied ASV table made previously, filters to keep only most abundant ASVs and generates heatmaps to show relative abundance of top ASVs across sampletypes
